# Tableau-CitiBike-Stations

# Project Overview
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Main Questions and Observations
1. How many total trips took place during the summer months of 2024 (July-September)?
-A total of 333,416 trips were taken during the summer months! This includes the tail end of June all the way to the end of September.
It is important to note that there is a dip (decrease) in ride percentage during the month of August. This could be due to an increase in temperature or ramp down after the holiday during July. 

3. What percentage has ridership grown over the summer period?
-We saw an increase of 2.92% over the summer months, this equates to roughly 3,270 more trips.

4. What are the top and bottom 10 stations for starting a trip in the city?
Based on trip count bar chart, we can clearly see which stations are more popular as a starting location. 

The following 10 locations were the most popular overall:
-Grove St PATH
-Hoboken Terminal- River St & Hudson Pl
-City Hall 
-Hoboken Terminal-Hudson St & Hudson Pl
-Exchange Pl 
-Hamilton Park 
-Neport Path 
-South Waterfront Walkway- Sinatra Dr & 1st St
-Newport Pkway 
-14 St Ferry- 14 St & Shipyard Ln

The following 10 locations were the least popular overall: 
-11 Ave & W 41 St
-Broadway & W 56 St
-Lexington Ave & E 111 St
-Liberty St & Nassau St
-North Moore St & Greenwich St
-W 16 St & The High Line
-W 41 St & 8 Ave
-Water St & Gouverneur Ln
-West St & Liberty St
-Grant Ave & MLK Dr


5. What are the top and bottom 10 stations for ending a trip in the city?
Based on the previous slide, we can clearly see which stations are more popular as an ending location. 

The following 10 locations were the most popular overall:
-Hoboken Terminal- River St & Hudson Pl
-Grant Path
-Hoboken Terminal- Hudson St & Hudson Pl
-City Hall- Washington St & 1 St
-14 St Ferry- 14 St & Shipyard Ln
-Bergen Ave & Sip Ave
-Hamilton Park
-Exchange Pl
-Newport PATH
-Newport Pkwy

The following 10 locations were the least popular overall: 
-1 Ave & E 6 St
-1 Ave & E 16 St
-3 Ave & E 72 St
-3 St & 3 Ave
-5 Ave & E 78 St
-6 Ave & W 34 St
-7 Ave & W 55 St
-7 Ave & S Bleecker St
-7 St & 3 Ave
-8 Ave & W 38 St

*It should be notes that the 10 least popular locations all had 1 trip counted, though there were more than 15 locations that had only 1 trip recorded.

# Further Conclusions and Additional Research
It is interesting to note that the most popular starting and ending locations are fairly similar. This could indicate that these are hot spots for tourists or house cultural events, like concerts or sports games. By taking a look at nearby noteable landmarks we can gather further conclusions on why these may be more popular. 

On the contrary, the least popular stations do not seem to line up as much. The least popular stations for the end of a trip seem to be across the water on the east side of the city. This could simply be due to the lack of available routes to these locations, or could be due to another socio-economic factor, such as crime rate. Futher research on the east side of the city (overall safety rating, walkability, etc) would provide further insight as to why these stations are less popular. 

I also find it interesting that we see a drop in trip counts over the month of August. Could this be due to the lack of events in the nearby area? Or is it more to due with the weather? Looking at temperature data and noteable landmarks could give us more insight as to why this phenomenon is occuring.
