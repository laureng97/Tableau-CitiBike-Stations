# Project Overview
Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

# Main Questions and Observations
1. How many total trips took place during the summer months of 2024 (July-September)?

2. What percentage has ridership grown over the summer period?

3. What are the top and bottom 10 stations for starting a trip in the city?

4. What are the top and bottom 10 stations for ending a trip in the city?
